        # HOW TO PLAY
 
 
 The idea of this project is simple, you can control the movement of a robotic arm.
 
 After you plug in the project, all you have to do is to press one of the three buttons to activate one of the three servos and then follow which one of the potentiometers leds is on. Beacause each part of the RobArm is controlled separately, if the led beside the potentiometer is on we can use that to control the servos.
